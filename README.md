- Python 3.x
- PyMuPDF library

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install PyMuPDF library using pip:


## Usage

1. Place the PDF file that you want to convert in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script using Python:
3. Enter the name of the PDF file when prompted.
4. Enter the desired name for the output file (without the .txt extension) when prompted.
5. The script will generate the Markdown text and save it to a .txt file with the specified name in the same directory as the script.
6. The generated Markdown text can be used as needed, such as for documentation, note-taking, or further processing.
